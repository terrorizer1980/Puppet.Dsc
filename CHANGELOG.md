## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ability to set generated modules fixtures to something other than the latest released version of `puppetlabs-pwshlib` on the Forge ([#93](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/issues/93))
- A check to `New-PuppetDscModule` which validates that PSRemoting is enabled and errors clearly if not in order to prevent unexpected execution failures later in the process ([#133](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/issues/133))
- Long file path support information to the requirements section of autogenerated READMEs ([#149](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/issues/149))

### Fixed

- Ensure that the auto-generated readme of a Puppetized module contains both the PowerShell and Puppet module names ([#153](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/issues/153))
- Make all `Update-PuppetModuleReadme` parameters except `PuppetModuleName` mandatory and do not accept null or empty values ([#153](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/issues/153))
- Make the  `PowerShellModuleName` and `PuppetModuleName` parameters in `Get-Readmecontent` mandatory and do not accept null or empty values for any parameters ([#153](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/issues/153))

- Entries for PSCredential and CIM instance examples to generated READMEs ([#114](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/issues/114))

### Added

- Explicit dependency on PowerShellGet `2.2.3+` ([#124](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/124))

### Changed

- Updated minimum supported version of the [`pwshlib`](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/pwshlib) module to [`0.7.0`](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/pwshlib/changelog#070-2021-01-20) to ensure changes from [#75](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/75) work in the provider.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-12-14

### Added

- `JoinOU` to the static list of DSC Resource properties which are Puppet parameters ([#107](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pulls/107))

## Fixed

### Added

- Known limitations section to generated README ([#56](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/56))

- Ability to Puppetize PowerShell modules marked as prerelease on the Gallery ([#76](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/76))
- Handling for non-retrievable DSC Resource properties as Puppet parameters ([#88](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/88))
- Clarification to generated README for properties passed to `Invoke-DscResource` and properties that set Puppet behavior ([#84](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/84))
- Handling for read-only properties, allowing them to be included in the generated types and appropriately marked ([#99](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/99))

### Changed

- Lower bound for `pwshlib-puppetlabs` raised to `0.6.1` ([#55](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/55))
- Upper bound for Puppet raised to `8.0.0` ([#101](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/101))
- Collapsed the `ensure` and `dsc_ensure` keywords into just `dsc_ensure` and _only_ for ensurable resources ([#88](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/88))

### Fixed

- Parseability of generated description strings in type files ([#77](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/77),[#83](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/83))
- Type generation for DSC Resource properties which are nested CIM instances with optional keys ([#78](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/78))
- Always downcase keys in structs for embedded CIM instances to prevent type definition errors ([#98](https://github.com/puppetlabs/Puppet.Dsc/pull/98))
